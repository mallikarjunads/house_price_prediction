# house_price_prediction
The House Price Prediction dataset contains information about properties and their sale prices to predict the value of a house based on its characteristics. Variables may include:

- Property features (number of bedrooms, square footage, location)
- Physical attributes (age, condition, size)
- Neighborhood characteristics (crime rate, school district, proximity to amenities)
- Market data (supply and demand, seasonality)

This dataset can be used to train machine learning models to predict house prices, helping real estate agents, buyers, and sellers make informed decisions and navigate the market moreÂ effectively.
